    "Google Colab allows you to write and execute Python code on remote servers. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No need to install Python or any libraries on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access to powerful computing resources directly from the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy collaboration by sharing notebooks with peers.\n",

    "- Sessions are temporary and may disconnect after a period of inactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are restrictions on GPU/TPU usage and RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The runtime environment resets after disconnecting, which means unsaved work is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dependency management can be challenging if specific package versions are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You always need to install and import the necessary libraries at the beginning of each notebook.\n",
