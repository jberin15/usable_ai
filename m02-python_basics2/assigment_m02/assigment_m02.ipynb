    "# Homework 1 Introduction to Python \n",
    "In this homework, we will be getting more experienced with python through file processing. With this guide, you will be able to:\n",
    "- read from a text (.txt) file\n",
    "- process the words of the file\n",
    "- output the result of this process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Follow the instructions on how to setup your Python and Jupyter (or VSCode) environment and cloning or downloading our repository. Instructions can be found in the class notes:\n",
    "   https://filipinascimento.github.io/usable_ai/m00-setup/class\n",
    "2. Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook working. (You can also try using Google Colab. This is not the preferred method for this homework, but it is an option)\n",
    "3. Load the text files: `story-1.txt`, `story-2.txt`, `story-3.txt`, and `story-4.txt`, located in the `Datasets` directory. (If you are using Google Colab, you will need to upload the files to the colab environment)\n",
    "4. Answer the questions below by writing or completing the code in the provided cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "The dataset consists of four text files, each containing a story. The stories are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `story-1.txt`: The Monkey and the Crocodile\n",
    "- `story-2.txt`: The Musical Donkey\n",
    "- `story-3.txt`: A Tale of Three Fish\n",
    "- `story-4.txt`: The Foolish Lion and the Clever Rabbit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit your completed notebook as a HTML export, or a PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To export to HTML, if you are on Jupyter, select `File` > `Export Notebook As` > `HTML`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on VSCode, you can use the `Jupyter: Export to HTML` command.\n",
    " - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).\n",
    "    - Search for `Jupyter: Export to HTML`.\n",
    "    - Save the HTML file to your computer and submit it via Canvas.\n",

    "> **Using Generative AI Responsibly**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You're welcome to use Generative AI to assist your learning, but focus on understanding the concepts rather than just solving the assignment. For example, instead of copying and pasting the question into the model, ask it to explain the concept in the question. Try asking: `How can I open a file in Python? Can you give me examples?` or `What functions and methods can I use to extract the words of a text file? Can you explain how they work with some examples?`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This way, you will learn how the solution works while building your skills. Remember to give context to the generative AI, so it can better assist you. Talk to the instructor and AIs if you have any questions or need insights.\n",

In the remainder of this guide, you will be filling in some value where ever a `_` or `...` is."
